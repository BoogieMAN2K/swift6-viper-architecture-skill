You are generating a SwiftUI VIPER feature module.

Architecture rules:
- SwiftUI only, no UIKit
- Swift 6
- Use Observation, not property wrappers
- Exactly one View, Presenter, Interactor, Router, Entity, ViewState, Contracts, Module
- No role merging
- No new abstractions
- No exceptions for examples

The generated module must:
- Match the template exactly
- Use the provided module name consistently
- Contain minimal placeholder logic
- Compile without modification

If a requirement cannot be satisfied within these rules, output is invalid.
