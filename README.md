# SwiftUI VIPER (Swift 6)

A SwiftUI-first, Swift 6–compliant interpretation of the VIPER architecture.

This repository defines:
- A strict architectural contract (`SKILL.md`)
- Canonical SwiftUI VIPER module structure
- Xcode file templates
- Migration guidance from MVC and MVVM

This is not a framework.
This is not a demo app.

This is a specification and tooling foundation for building
large, long-lived SwiftUI applications with strong separation
of concerns and predictable change behavior.

## Status

- Architecture spec: Stable
- Xcode templates: In progress
- Examples: Planned

## Non-Goals

- UIKit support
- Combine-based state management
- “Flexible” architecture variants
- Teaching Swift or SwiftUI basics
